This dataset supports the study titled "Sex ratio bias triggers demographic suicide in a dense tortoise population", which examines the role of coercive mating on variability in adult sex ratio and by extent on the population viability of Hermann’s tortoises. The specific datasets (.csv files starting with “PopulationSize_&_sexRatio…”) include betas and variance covariance matrices of the annual capture probabilities extracted for tortoises from the time-specific versions of the best-fit models estimating survival and capture probabilities. The data were generated to estimate populations sizes, and adult and operational sex ratios in the three localities (Plateau, Beach and Konjsko). The betas and variance covariance matrices for the Plateau and Beach are under files marked as "Golem Grad", as the best fit time-specific model implies no differences in capture probability between the two island localities; Konjsko has sepparate matrices. Analyses performed in R (script included).
