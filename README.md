This dataset supports the study titled "Coercive mating under sex ratio bias drives island tortoises extinct", which examines the role of coercive mating on variability in adult sex ratio and by extent on the population viability of island tortoises. It includes a matrix of capture recpature data of adult torotises collected over 16 years on Golem Grad Island in Prespa Lake, North Macedonia. The data were generated to analyze survival probability and population extinction risk. Observations were conducted under standardized protocols, survival analyses were modelled in E-SURGE, and population simulations were run using R. This dataset provides a resource for further studies on population dynamics.
