This dataset supports the study titled "Coercive mating under sex ratio bias drives island tortoises extinct", which examines the role of coercive mating on variability in adult sex ratio and by extent on the population viability of island tortoises. It includes a matrix of capture recapture data of adult tortoises collected over 16 years on Golem Grad Island in Prespa Lake, North Macedonia. The data were generated to analyze survival probability and capture probabilities. Observations were conducted under standardized protocols, survival and capture probability analyses were modelled in E-SURGE. This dataset provides a resource for further studies on population dynamics.
