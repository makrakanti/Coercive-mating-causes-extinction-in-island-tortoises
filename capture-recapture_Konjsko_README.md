This dataset supports the study titled "Sex ratio bias triggers demographic suicide in a dense tortoise population", which examines the role of coercive mating on variability in adult sex ratio and by extent on the population viability of Hermannâ€™s tortoises. The specific dataset includes a matrix of capture recapture data of adult tortoises collected over 14 years in Konjsko village in the Prespa region of North Macedonia. The data were generated to analyze survival probability and capture probabilities. Observations were conducted under standardized protocols, survival and capture probability analyses were modelled in E-SURGE. This dataset provides a resource for further studies on population dynamics.
