This dataset supports the study titled "Coercive mating under sex ratio bias drives island tortoises extinct", which examines the role of coercive mating on variability in adult sex ratio and by extent on the population viability of Hermann’s tortoises. The specific dataset includes a table of body condition indices (calculated as body mass divided by straight carapace length) from capture recapture data (Individual – individual numbers given at capture) of adult tortoises. The data was collected from three localities, the Plateau and Beach of Golem Grad Island and from Konjsko village, both in the Prespa region of North Macedonia. The localities for each measurement provided under the column “Locality”. On the Plateau and Beach data was collected over 16 years, and in Konjsko village over 14 years (column “Year”). The season of data collection marked under the column “Season”. The data were generated to analyze variability in body condition between localities, years and seasons and using individuals as a random factor to avoid pseudoreplication. We used generalized linear mixed models in R.
