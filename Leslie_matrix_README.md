This scripts support the study titled "Coercive mating under sex ratio bias drives island tortoises extinct", which examines the role of coercive mating on variability in adult sex ratio and by extent on the population viability of Hermann’s tortoises. The specific scripts (.txt files starting with “Leslie_matrix_…”) provide scripts to simulate population growth in the three studied populations (files ending with “…Plateau/Beach/Konjsko). Analyses performed in R (script included).
