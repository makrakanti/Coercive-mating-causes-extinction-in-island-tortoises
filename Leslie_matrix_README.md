This scripts support the study titled "Sex ratio bias triggers demographic suicide in a dense tortoise population", which examines the role of coercive mating on variability in adult sex ratio and by extent on the population viability of Hermann’s tortoises. The specific scripts (.txt files starting with “Leslie_matrix_…”) provide scripts to simulate population growth in the three studied populations (files ending with “…Plateau/Beach/Konjsko"). Analyses performed in R (script included).
